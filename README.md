# Project Title

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing insurance data to identify trends, calculate losses and profits, and generate insightful visualizations. The project is divided into several tasks, including data summarization, univariate analysis, bivariate/multivariate analysis, data comparison, and visualizations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script to perform data analysis and generate visualizations:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Data Summarization
The data summarization step involves loading the data, checking for missing values, removing duplicates, and converting columns to appropriate data types. It also includes calculating descriptive statistics and visualizing the distribution of numerical columns.

## Univariate Analysis
The univariate analysis step involves plotting histograms and bar charts for numerical and categorical columns, respectively. This helps in understanding the distribution of individual columns.

## Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
The bivariate/multivariate analysis step involves plotting scatter plots and calculating correlation matrices to understand the relationships between different columns. It also includes visualizing monthly changes in `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaims`.

## Data Comparison
The data comparison step involves calculating monthly changes for `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaims`, and visualizing trends for different fields such as `CoverType` and `make` using bar charts and line plots.

## Visualizations
The visualizations step involves generating bar plots for total profit/loss, frequency percentage, and average profit/loss per frequency for different columns. It also includes defining a function to calculate losses and profits for a given column and show top N results.

## Unit Tests
The unit tests step involves testing various functions and data processing steps using the `unittest` framework. It includes tests for data types, difference calculation, the `calculate_losses` function, missing values, and negative values removal.
